abstract = {In this paper a concise overview of the work that has been done by various researchers in the area of type-2 fuzzy logic is analyzed and discussed. Type-2 fuzzy systems have been widely applied in the fields of intelligent control, pattern recognition and classification, among others. The overview mainly focuses on past, present and future trends of type-2 fuzzy logic applications. Of utmost importance is the last part, outlining possible areas of applied research in type-2 FL in the future. The major contribution of the paper is briefing of the most relevant work in the area of type-2 fuzzy logic, including its theoretical and practical implications. As well as envisioning possible future works and trends in this area of research. We believe that this paper will provide a good platform for people interested in this area for their future research work.}

abstract = {The high social costs associated with bankruptcy have spurred searches for better theoretical understanding and prediction capability. In this paper, we investigate a hybrid approach to bankruptcy prediction, using a genetic programming algorithm to construct a bankruptcy prediction model with variables from a rough sets model derived in prior research. Both studies used data from 291 US public companies for the period 1991 to 1997. The second stage genetic programming model developed in this research consists of a decision model that is 80% accurate on a validation sample as compared to the original rough sets model which was 67% accurate. Additionally, the genetic programming model reveals relationships between variables that are not apparent in either the rough sets model or prior research. These findings indicate that genetic programming coupled with rough sets theory can be an efficient and effective hybrid modeling approach both for developing a robust bankruptcy prediction model and for offering additional theoretical insights.}
